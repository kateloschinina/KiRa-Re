The concept of the installation is based on the Pythagorean idea of The Harmonies of Celestial Spheres. The participants become individual planets, each of them carrying a different sound, which change and develop, depending where the participants are positioned in the space, and in relation to each other. The space will be mapped to form a celestial sound “mandala”.'

Accord is an interactive space where people communicate through their body movements and the sound they create. '
